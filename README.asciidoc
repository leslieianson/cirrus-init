= cirrus-init

[.lead]
A System V init script which executes Bash scripts curled from EC2 instance user data.

Named after http://www.clouds-online.com/cloud_atlas/cirrus/cirrus.htm[thin, high-altitude clouds], `cirrus-init` was hacked together as a simple alternative to Canonical's https://launchpad.net/cloud-init[`cloud-init`] specifically for use with CentOS 6.x AMIs.

If your user data starts with a `#!/bin/bash` shebang, `cirrus-init` will execute it as `root` at boot.

Just do...

[source, shell]
